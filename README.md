# pogoplug_static_binaries
Statically-linked binaries compiled for the stock busybox-based Linux distribution which comes with Pogoplug v4 devices (Pogoplug Mobile and Pogoplug Series 4).

* from wget-1.12
  * [wget](https://github.com/pepaslabs/pogoplug_static_binaries/blob/master/bin/wget?raw=true) (with HTTPS support)

**NOTE:** The `wget` binary which comes with the Pogoplug's stock busybox-based Linux distribution doesn't have HTTPS support, which means it cannot download files from github, dropbox, etc (which all redirect HTTP traffic to HTTPS URLs automatically).  For this reason, the above `wget` static binary is also hosted on Amazon S3 (see http://pogoplug.s3.amazonaws.com/wget), which still allows plain old HTTP, which means a stock Pogoplug can download it. 

* from util-linux-2.17.2:
  * [fdisk](https://github.com/pepaslabs/pogoplug_static_binaries/blob/master/bin/fdisk?raw=true)
  * [sfdisk](https://github.com/pepaslabs/pogoplug_static_binaries/blob/master/bin/sfdisk?raw=true)
  * [mkswap](https://github.com/pepaslabs/pogoplug_static_binaries/blob/master/bin/mkswap?raw=true)
  * [ionice](https://github.com/pepaslabs/pogoplug_static_binaries/blob/master/bin/ionice?raw=true)

* from binutils-2.20.1
  * [ar](https://github.com/pepaslabs/pogoplug_static_binaries/blob/master/bin/ar?raw=true)

### Build procedure (general)

All of these binaries were built in a Debian squeeze chroot on a Pogoplug Mobile (booted into the stock Pogoplug linux installation).

In general, the build procedure is:

```
apt-get source foo
apt-get build-dep foo
cd foo-0.1
./configure LDFLAGS='-static'
make
```

### Build procedure (wget)

`wget` had to be built using the following steps.

```
apt-get build-deb wget
apt-get source wget
cd wget
```

```
./configure LDFLAGS="-static" --with-ssl
make
```

The above `make` command will fail.  I had to do this instead (thanks to http://stackoverflow.com/a/9833936):

```
env CPPFLAGS="-I/usr/include" LDFLAGS="-L/usr/lib/ssl" ./configure --with-ssl=openssl
make CPPFLAGS="-I/usr/include" LDFLAGS="-L/usr/lib -L/usr/lib/ssl -static"
```

However, that still fails to link, with a bunch of errors like this:

```
(.text+0x9b0): undefined reference to `inflateInit_'
/usr/lib/libcrypto.a(c_zlib.o): In function `zlib_stateful_init':
(.text+0x9fc): undefined reference to `deflateInit_'
collect2: ld returned 1 exit status
```

I had to repeat the the last `gcc` call manually with the addition of an extra `-lz` at the end of the command line:

```
cd src
gcc -O2 -Wall -L/usr/lib -L/usr/lib/ssl -lz -static -o wget cmpt.o connect.o convert.o cookies.o ftp.o css.o css-url.o ftp-basic.o ftp-ls.o hash.o host.o html-parse.o html-url.o http.o init.o log.o main.o netrc.o progress.o ptimer.o recur.o res.o retr.o snprintf.o spider.o url.o utils.o exits.o build_info.o  version.o ftp-opie.o openssl.o http-ntlm.o gen-md5.o ../lib/libgnu.a  -lssl -lcrypto -ldl -lrt -lz
```

You should now have a working wget static binary (with HTTPS support).
